## Making a repository on github

* First write a command to initialize a empty git repository by writing command:
``` bash
   git init
```
this will create initialize a empty git repository.

* Next we have to add the files and commit them.

* We can add files by command:
``` bash
   git add <name of file>
```
this will add a specified file

* If you want to add all the files in one command you can write:
``` bash
   git add .
```
this will add the files to the repository.

* Now we have to commit our changes by typing command: 
``` bash
   git commit -m "<commit message>"
```

* Now we have to add a remote to our repository by a command:
``` bash
   git remote add <name of remote> "URL"
```
this will add a remote to your repository, you will get the URL when creating a repository on github.

* Now we have add the files, committed them, added a remote (where it will be pushed) and now we have to push it to github, we can write the command:
``` bash
   git push -u <name of remote> <name of branch>
```
By default our first branch is master, so if you have only one branch you can write master in the branch name like this, assuming that you have a remote of name origin:
``` bash
   git push -u origin master
```

* We can also get these commands from the github when creating a new repository.

* Next time, if we have done some changes, we have to add the file, commit it and push it by typing this command:
``` bash
   git push
```
this will push the new files to the github.

* If we are working in a team then we can pull or fetch the other's team members code by typing command:
``` bash
   git pull
```
this will checks that everything is up-to-date, if not updated this will pull the code from the remote.

* If we want to clone a repository we can write a command:
``` bash
   git clone "URL"
```
